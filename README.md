## 👋 The story behind this work-samples

🚀 Someone asked my past samples of work and i was too lazy to create domain or  subdomain page for this and host it on server and send the link, Sending portfolio by email, xls sheet, work doc, dropbox, gdrive link is passe', ancient and stone-aged. So, Github Pages came to my mind as a rescue option, live in 15 mins flat. 🎨💻✨

## 🎨 What's Inside?

- **Detailed CV** - My professional life story (without the BS stains)
- **UX Portfolio** - Where I prove that I can make buttons both pretty AND clickable
- **Wireframes** - The blueprints of digital dreams
- **Live Projects** - Real stuff that actually works! (Please don't break them)
- **Blog Posts** - My thoughts, but organized and spell-checked
- **Documentation** - Because even I forget how my code works sometimes

## 📚 Feature Documentation Example

Because sometimes we need to prove that we not only build stuff but can also explain how it works:
- PRDs that team members must enjoy reading
- Video explainers that won't put you to sleep
- Figma designs that spark joy
- Code that's actually documented (yes, really!)
