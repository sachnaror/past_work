## 👋 Hey there, digital explorer!

Welcome to my portfolio repo - where code meets creativity, and pixels align perfectly (most of the time). This is where I showcase my journey through the tech wilderness, armed with nothing but a keyboard and an unreasonable amount of optimism.

## 🎨 What's Inside?

- **Detailed CV** - My professional life story (without the coffee stains)
- **UX Portfolio** - Where I prove that I can make buttons both pretty AND clickable
- **Wireframes** - The blueprints of digital dreams
- **Live Projects** - Real stuff that actually works! (Please don't break them)
- **Blog Posts** - My thoughts, but organized and spell-checked
- **Documentation** - Because even I forget how my code works sometimes

## 🔧 Tech Stack

```
Coffee + Code = Magic ✨
```

## 📚 Feature Documentation Example

Because sometimes we need to prove that we not only build stuff but can also explain how it works:
- PRDs that even product managers enjoy reading
- Video explainers that won't put you to sleep
- Figma designs that spark joy
- Code that's actually documented (yes, really!)
